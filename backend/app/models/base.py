# --- Connection pool configuration -------------------------------------------
# IMPORTANT: this application shares a single PostgreSQL server with other
# services (notably the OnCallHealthData admin dashboard). PostgreSQL caps the
# total number of concurrent connections via `max_connections`, so the SUM of
# (DB_POOL_SIZE + DB_MAX_OVERFLOW) across EVERY process and service that talks
# to the database must stay comfortably below that ceiling. Exceeding it makes
# new connections fail with "FATAL: sorry, too many clients already".
#
# Budgeting rule of thumb (check the real ceiling with `SHOW max_connections;`):
#   sum over all processes(pool_size + max_overflow) + headroom  <  max_connections
# e.g. 2 processes here (web + worker) x (10 + 10) = 40, leaving room for the
# admin dashboard and ad-hoc psql sessions under a typical 100-connection cap.
#
# Every value is environment-overridable so the pool can be retuned for a given
# Railway/Postgres plan WITHOUT a code deploy. Defaults are deliberately
# conservative (previously these were a hard-coded 30 + 20 = 50 per process,
# which alone could exhaust the shared server).
POOL_SIZE = _int_env("DB_POOL_SIZE", 10)          # persistent connections kept warm
MAX_OVERFLOW = _int_env("DB_MAX_OVERFLOW", 10)    # extra burst connections beyond pool_size
POOL_TIMEOUT = _int_env("DB_POOL_TIMEOUT", 30)    # seconds a request waits for a free connection
POOL_RECYCLE = _int_env("DB_POOL_RECYCLE", 1800)  # recycle connections older than this many seconds

# Query timeout settings (in milliseconds)
STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS = _int_env("DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS", 60000)  # 60 seconds default
LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS = _int_env("DB_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS", 30000)            # 30 seconds default

# Idle-transaction reaper (in milliseconds). Railway Postgres has no idle
# timeout and its TCP proxy keeps orphaned backends ESTABLISHED, so a connection
# left idle-in-transaction (e.g. a leaked/stranded session that opened a
# transaction but never committed) would otherwise live forever and count
# against the shared max_connections budget until the server is fully locked out
# ("FATAL: sorry, too many clients already"). This makes Postgres itself close
# such connections so a leak can never saturate the server. pool_pre_ping
# reconnects transparently when the server closes a pooled connection.
#
# NOTE: we deliberately do NOT set idle_session_timeout here. It would reap idle
# connections regardless of transaction state — including the warm pooled
# connections we intend to keep — and it is only recognized on PostgreSQL 14+,
# so on an older server every connection would be rejected at connect time
# ("FATAL: unrecognized configuration parameter"). idle_in_transaction_session_timeout
# is supported since PostgreSQL 9.6 and only targets leaked transactions, which
# is the actual connection-leak hazard we need to guard against.
IDLE_IN_TX_TIMEOUT_MS = _int_env("DB_IDLE_IN_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT_MS", 60000)      # 60 seconds

# Tag every connection so it is identifiable in pg_stat_activity. This is what
# lets you run, during an incident:
#   SELECT application_name, count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC;
# and see at a glance which service is holding connections.
